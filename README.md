# CS230-Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room client wants to create an online-based mulitplay game based on drawing designs and guessing what is being drawn.
They only used Windows in the office but wants the game to be available on multiple different devices which leads to certain design and business constraints.
I believe I was very thorough in my design document. I did a good amount of research on the capabilities of Linux and MacOS because I did not know much about those systems.
Through the research I was able to make a confident decision as to what the best route for the company to take would be.
I personally did not find the design document itself to make programming any easier. It seemed to me to be more or a tool for a programming company to explain to a business
what restraints there are and what needs to be done on a easier to digest level. 
I actually think that the design charts made the programming aspect easiest.
To improve the design document, I think that instead of a table that shows the difference and requirements of each operating system, I would rather write a paragraph for each.
I think compacting all of the words into the table makes it more jumbled but it does put all of the information right there in front of you.
I think I implemented the user's needs into the design exactly how they were asking. They needed to be able to have people log in, have a way to verify the accounts, have a way to 
have games specific to those accounts, and I did those things. The user's needs are very important because if it is not going to do what the people are asking for, then your job wasn't done
correctly and that is not a good business model to have. That is why communication with clients is extremely important.
My approach to designing software was to look at the exact needs of the client and work through each one individually, one at a time. By using the design chart, I was able to 
decide exactly how to implement the code without forgetting something important.
